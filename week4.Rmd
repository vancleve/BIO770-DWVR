# Another slice of slicing

Last time, we covered much of the basics of slicing matrices but there are still some topics and some helper functions that will be useful to know when trying to accomplish certain tasks.

## Assigning to a slice

Not only can you extract a slice of a matrix to analyze or plot but you can also assign values to that slice. First, create a matrix of all zeros to manipulate:
```{r}
allz = matrix(0, nrow = 6, ncol = 6)
```
As before, you slice the first row.
```{r}
allz[1,]
```
However, you can also assign values to it.
```{r}
allz[1,] = 1:6
allz
```
Note that when assigning to a slice, the right-hand side must be of the same dimensionality as the left-hand side. For example, the following will not work:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
allz[1,] = 1:4
```
The one exception to this rule is when the number of items on the right hand side is a multiple of the number of elements in the slice. The simplest example is 
```{r}
allz[1,] = 1
allz
```
but you can also do
```{r}
allz[1,] = 1:3
allz
```
where the right hand side is use as many times as necessary to fill the slice.

## Sorting

Sorting numeric and character values is an important task that comes up in many applications. The `sort` function has reasonable defaults where it produces increasing numeric values
```{r}
set.seed(100)
rvec = sample(1:100, 20, replace = TRUE)
rvec
sort(rvec)
```
or character values
```{r}
svec = c("hello", "world", "goodbye", "grand", "planet")
sort(svec)
```
You can reverse the sort order by setting the argument `decreasing = TRUE`.

## Getting the indices from slices

### Sorting

Often, you will want to sort not only a vector by the rows of a data matrix based on some column of the matrix. Thus, you need the list of positions each row will go to (e.g., row 1 to row 10 because its 10th in the sorted order, etc). To obtain this, you can use the `order` function
```{r}
order(svec)
```
which output precisely that list of indices. If you stick these indices back into the vector, you will obtain the original `sort` operation
```{r}
svec[ order(svec) ]
sort(svec)
```
You can also use the "sort order" of one column to order the rows of a whole matrix or data table. For example, using a matrix of random values, 
```{r}
set.seed(42)
rmatx = matrix(sample(1:20, 36, replace = TRUE), nrow = 6, ncol = 6)
rmatx
```
you could then sort the rows based on elements in the first column by first obtaining the indices used to sort that column
```{r}
order(rmatx[,1])
```
and using the indices to order the rows
```{r}
rmatx[ order(rmatx[,1]), ]
```

### Boolean (logical) slicing

Recall that you can slice by creating a logical condition (generating `TRUE` and `FALSE` values) and use that in the index of a matrix. Sometimes, you want the actual indices of the elements of that matrix that are sliced; i.e., you want the indices of the elements where the conditions is `TRUE`. To get these indices, you use the `which` function. For example, the logical and index vectors are
```{r}
rmatx[,1] > 10
which(rmatx[,1] > 10)
```
and the slices are
```{r}
rmatx[ rmatx[,1] > 10, ]
rmatx[ which( rmatx[,1] > 10 ), ]
```

Finally, there some special versions of the `which` function that give you the first index of the max or min element of a vector, `which.max` and `which.min`. Those would have been helpful last week. Doh!

# Names and attributes

One topic to cover before introducing data frames concerns names and attributes. Attributes are "metadata" attached to an object where that data has a name and value. The only attributes that you need to consider now are "names" that are strings that give the names of each element in a vector. You have already seen with lists how each element can be given a name. More generally, vectors can have names for each element and matrices can have names for each row and each column.

To give a vector names, simply assign the name when creating the vector
```{r}
named_svec = c(s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", s3 = "goodbye", s4 = "grand", s5 = "planet")
named_svec
str(named_svec)
```
and you can recover those names with the `names` function
```{r}
names(named_svec)
```
You can also set the names afterwards by assigning to `names`:
```{r}
names(svec) = c("s1", "s2", "s3", "s4", "s5")
svec
```
Finally, you can return a version of the vector with the names stripped using the function `uname`
```{r}
unname(named_svec)
```
though note that this hasn't changed the original vector:
```{r}
named_svec
```
Finally, you can get rid of the names entirely by assigning `names` to `NULL`
```{r}
names(named_svec) = NULL
named_svec
```
Just as reminder, while we can name elements of vectors, they still have to hold the same data type, unlike lists that can hold anything.
```{r}
str(list(a=1, b="two"))
str(c(a=1, b="two"))
```


# Factors

A special object that you will see when dealing with data frames is called a "factor". A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values and essentially stores categorical data (e.g., "tall", "medium", and "short" for plant height). Factors have a "levels" attribute that lists the allowable values. For example
```{r}
fac_factor = factor(c("Famulski", "Van Cleve", "Seifert", "Santollo", "Duncan", "Schneider"))
fac_factor
```
If you try to set an element of the factor object to a value outside of `levels`, you will receive a warning
```{r}
fac_factor[1] = "Jones"
fac_factor
```
and the element will be converted to the `NA` value, which is used for missing data. 

Many R functions that read data tables take advantage of this behavior of factors so that columns may only contain certain values and the other values are missing data. This occurs when the function runs into a column with string data and the R function will often convert that column to a factor. Some of the functions that read data tables have nice arguments that let you tell them that specific strings, say "-", represent missing data and should be be converted to `NA`. 

While useful, factors are extremely annoying when your data are converted to them when you don't expect it: <https://simplystatistics.org/2015/07/24/stringsasfactors-an-unauthorized-biography/>.

# Data frames

Finally we have reached data frames. Data frames are the **most common way of storing data in R**. Essentially, a data frame is a list object containing vectors of equal length (i.e., the number of rows of the table). Put another way, a data frame is a `list` version of a matrix. Thus, data frames have properties such as `length()`, `rnow()`, `ncol()` `colnames()`, and `rownames()`.

Creating a data frame is like creating a list where you name your elements, which here are columns (data not guaranteed to be accurate...):
```{r}
dframe = data.frame(height_rank = 1:4, last_name = c("Van Cleve", "Linnen", "Seifert", "Pendergast"), first_name = c("Jeremy", "Catherine", "Ashley", "Julie"))
dframe
```
Slicing a data frame works like slicing a matrix or a list. Often, we will use the list convention where columns can be obtained with `$`. For example,
```{r}
dframe$first_name
dframe$last_name
```

Adding columns to a data frame is done with `cbind` (column bind), which glues together columns,
```{r}
cbind(dframe, building = c("MDR3", "THM", "THM", "THM"))
```
and adding rows with `rbind`, which glues together rows,
```{r}
rbind(dframe, data.frame(height_rank = 0, last_name = "Smith", first_name = "Jeramiah"))
```
Again, note that each of these commands returned a **new** `data.frame` and the original is unchanged until we explicitly save back to that variable name:
```{r}
dframe
```

# Reading data tables

Now that you know about data frames, you can start using some nice R functions to read in data. You have already done this with data from the homework from last week. Before loading in these data, load the following packages (they are nice for reading csv and excel files)
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # loads the `readr` package that loads things like csv files
library(readxl) # package for reading Excel files
```

Now, you can use the `read_csv` function to get the data table from last week.
```{r}
congress = read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/generic-ballot-data/generic_polllist.csv")
```
Notice that `read_csv` gives you some nice output telling us about the table you just read. This function and others like it (i.e., from the `readr` and `readxl` packages) do a lot for you automatically and have many nice features, some of which we'll cover later.

Loading excel files in no harder. We'll load some data from a RNA-seq paper on genomic imprinting (Babak et al. 2015. Nat Gen, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3274>), `babak-etal-2015_imprinted-mouse.xlsx`, with `read_excel`
```{r}
imprint = read_excel("babak-etal-2015_imprinted-mouse.xlsx", na = "NaN")
```
Note that you have to tell the function what strings in the Excel spreadsheet correspond to `NA` or missing data ("NaN" in this case). The first column are the gene names for each row
```{r}
imprint$Genes
```
and the column names are the tissue type that RNA expression was measured in
```{r}
colnames(imprint)
```
where the first element is the column name of the "Genes" column. You will manipulate these data later when we talk about tidy data and `dplyr`.

# Lab ![](assets/beaker.png)

Now that you have all the essential elements of slicing (more elements require specialized functions in packages like `dplyr`), you can do more sophisticated things with the polling data from last week, which you should load like this:
```{r}
library(lubridate)

congress = read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/generic-ballot-data/generic_polllist.csv")
congress$startdate = mdy(congress$startdate)
congress$enddate = mdy(congress$enddate)

polls = congress[congress$enddate < "2018-09-01",]
```

### Problems
    
1. Sort the whole `polls` data frame according to the name of the pollster.

2. Sort the `polls` data frame according to the "samplesize", **highest to lowest.**

3. Suppose now that you would like to know how the "grade" of the polls, which is how fivethirtyeight.com labels the accuracy and reliability of a poll, relates to the sample size. Naively, you could just try to plot using the `plot` function `plot(x,y)` where `x` is the grade of the polls and `y` is the sample size. What happens when you try this?

4. Assuming that the previous "naive" solution didn't work, think about what kind of R data type (hint: introduced this week) might be appropriate for working with data like `polls$grade`. You can actually convert `polls$grade` to this data type with `as.X` where `X` is the data type you think is the right one. Try now plotting with `plot(x,y)` where `x` is this converted grade column and `y` is the sample size column. R should do something very helpful here that helps you figure out how grade and sample size are related. How are they related???

* Challenge problem (+3 extra credit)

    Plot a heatmap of the imprinting data using the `heatmap` function. The rows and columns of the heatmap should be labeled properly with the gene names (rows) and tissue names (columns). The Babak et al. (2015) paper has a similar heatmap in Fig 1. Hint: read carefully the help for the `heatmap` function and know that you can convert data frames to matrices with `as.matrix`.
